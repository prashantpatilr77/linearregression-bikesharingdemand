## General Information
Background :
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.
Objective :
Understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:
Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes. How well those variables describe the bike demands Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.
The data set provided covers the demant of shared bikes with respect to season, working and holidays for year 2018 and 2019. It also lists the weather cpnidiotns

## Conclusions
The temperature, past year demands, weather of the day and season are prime factors driving demand of shared bikes. It has been observed between the range of 25 and 35 degrees, the demand is on higher side while spring season and weather with light rain  /snow has negative impact. The demand increased on year on year basis for the years 2018 and 2019 indicating some form of law of attraction. 

Overall the higher marketing spend can be targeted for summer and fall season that enables demand of shared bikes.
